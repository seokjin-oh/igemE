\#Plasmid Construction of Heme Biosensor System 1. Standard PCR to obtain target fragments

2.  1% Agarose Gel Electrophoresis to identify PCR products

3.  DpnI Restriction Enzyme Digestion to eliminate templates

4.  Gel DNA Extraction and Purification or PCR clean-up to purify PCR products

5.  Homologous Recombination

6.  Bacterial Transformation

7.  Colony PCR

8.  Bacterial glycerol stock

9.  Plasmid Extraction

\#Protocols of repoter protein expression (Characterization of HBS-BAS)

1.  Inoculate E.coli-pHBS-cI-pA1C-R0051-RFP-I12007-GFP, E.coli-HrtO-cI-pA1C-R0051-RFP-I12007-GFP, E.coli-pSB1C3-K608010, E.coli-pSB1K3-J04450 and E.coli-wildtype in LB medium. Resuscitate it in incubator at 37℃ and 200 rpm, overnight.

2.  Inoculate the bacterial solution into a 96-well plate in the manner of 100 μL/well, with 3 groups in parallel. LB medium was used as the control group.

3.  Measure the OD600 and fluorescence intensity (GFP: ex: 475 nm, em: 515 nm; RFP: ex:588 nm, em: 635 nm) of the plates by the Microplate spectrophotometer.

4.  The following formula was used to calculate the relative fluorescence intensity of bacteria, using LB medium as blank.
